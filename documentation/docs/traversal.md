# Promise and Select traversal API

KMF is in roots asynchronous, this mean that you have to define a callback object object to retrieve the result of a relationship navigation for instance.
This asynchronous aspect add a bit complexity when man has to travers a deep structure.
Thus, similarly to graph database, KMF offer APIs to traverse directly several layer, similarly to some graph query languages.
